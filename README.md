## Project Goals

Vertex is not just a collection of board games — it is being built as a reusable engine capable of supporting multiple rule sets and visual styles.

The long-term goal is to:

- Expand the supported game library
- Improve modularity and scalability
- Refine engine architecture
- Maintain a clean separation between game logic and presentation

## Technical Notes

- All graphics were created from scratch.
- The entire codebase was rewritten independently.
- Originally inspired by a YouTube tutorial, but fully restructured and reimplemented.

---

## Future Plans

- Add more board games
- Expand theme customization
- Improve engine extensibility
- Refactor toward more data-driven rule definitions
